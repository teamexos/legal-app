In addition to using Cookies, a website or other on-line system operated by any of Us may employ "pixel tracking", a common process which may be used in connection with advertisements and or internal tracking. Pixel tracking involves the use of pixel tags that are not visible to the user and consist of a few lines of computer code. Pixel tracking allows Us to compile aggregate and specific usage statistics. A "pixel tag" is an invisible tag placed on certain pages of websites that is used to track an individual user's activity for the purposes of the Program. We may access these pixel tags to identify user activity. If you visit a website or other on-line system operated by any of Us, and We link you to another website, We may also be able to determine that You were sent to and/or transacted with a third party website. Your data may be compiled in aggregate for use in our marketing and research.
