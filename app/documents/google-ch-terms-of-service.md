**_PLACE OF STORAGE; TRANSFER OF PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THE U.S._**

Personal Information collected through Ops will be transferred to our private cloud based servers that are located at our data center provider: Amazon Web Services.  We currently use two data centers with AWS.  One in located in Northern Virginia and the other is Oregon—both within the United States.

**_PROCESSION AND USE OF THE PERSONAL INFORMATION IN THE U.S._**

CP international uses your Personal Information to provide Fitness Center services onsite at the Fitness Center location(s) of which you are a member and are eligible to use.  Our staff at the Fitness Center may use the Personal Information you provide to provide you with the services you request or desire.

API develops and provides CP International with our cloud based application called "Ops" that integrates into the Fitness Center and has some features (such as Cardio, (formerly ESD)) that integrates into some of the cardiovascular fitness equipment that can collect Personal Information.  You may also interface with certain Ops features directly via a common Internet browser by logging on with a username and password from an account you created. API has implemented encryption during transmission and in storage to protect Personal Information and Sensitive Personal Information that you provide while it is transferred over the public Internet and stored within our servers at AWS.  Only those with a business need to provide you with the services you request have access to your Personal Information within Ops.  API may provide support should you experience a problem with Ops that our onsite staff cannot resolve.

AWS is our cloud based data center and hosting company.  Your Personal Information is not shared with or disclosed to AWS.  API manages our private server infrastructure that is located within AWS.

Should you have an arrangement with the "Sponsor" (as defined herein) of the Fitness Center that allows you to use CP International managed Fitness Centers of the Sponsor located within the European Union or Switzerland, you may do so and your Personal Information may be accessible and collected via Ops at these locations by you and our staff.

Should you have an arrangement with the Sponsor of the Fitness Center that allows you to use Fitness Centers of the Sponsor that are located in the United States, you may do so and your Personal Information may be accessible and collected via Ops at these locations by you and our staff located at such sites in the United States. At such sites, Core Performance (our worksite fitness center management subsidiary in the US) may have a need to access your Personal Information within Ops and you may continue to interface with Ops in the same fashion as you would at your primary Fitness Center location in the EU or Switzerland.

**_GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF THE COLLECTION, PROCESSION AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION THROUGH THE PROGRAM_****.**

The Personal Information and/or Sensitive Personal Information you provide us via Ops is based on the Fitness Center and Program services you request, desire and use, as well as the information you provide.  The information helps our team provide you with services that are designed to allow you to enhance your personal fitness and wellness based on our four pillars of movement. Information disclosed to our staff at the Fitness Center via CP International can be placed, updated or corrected within Ops if necessary.  This information is stored on servers and via an application managed and supported by API.

Your Personal Information may be transferred to (made accessible via Ops to) API’s subsidiary, Core Performance, should you choose to use (and are authorized by the Sponsor and/or CP International to use) a Fitness Center and related services provided by us within the United States.** **

To the extent permitted by law, you own the Personal Information that you provide the Program.  Should you wish us to no longer have access or collect your Personal Information, please see the opt-out procedures as described above.

**End User Data License and Aggregate End User Data License:** You grant to API and CP International: (i) a non-exclusive, irrevocable, enterprise-wide, fully sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to access, use, and disclose your Personal Information as described in these Terms and Conditions during the Term of our Agreement with Google and only in the event solely in connection with our performance of the Services that you have requested from use (the "End User Data License"); and (ii) a non-exclusive, irrevocable, enterprise-wide, fully sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to access, use, and disclose aggregate and anonymous data comprised of deidentified data (that cannot be identified to you) during the term of our Agreement with Google and in perpetuity thereafter (the “Aggregated End User Data License”) subject to the following: such Aggregated End User Data License does not include data made available to us after you have revoked your End User Data License through the Opt-Out Method set forth in this Terms and Conditions and the Privacy Policy.  If you revoke the End User Data License, API and CP International will  deidentify your Personal Information so that it becomes Aggregated End User Data and your End User Data License with API and CP International will be automatically terminated.
