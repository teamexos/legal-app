                <p>ATTENTION: USE OF THE JOURNEY SOFTWARE IS SUBJECT TO THE ATHLETES’ PERFORMANCE EULA SET FORTH BELOW. USING THE SOFTWARE INDICATES YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE LICENSE TERMS. </p>

                <h2>Athletes’ Performance EULA </h2>

                <p>The following license terms govern the use of the accompanying Journey Software (the “Software”). </p>

                <p><b>License Grant.</b> Athletes’ Performance grants you a license to use one (1) object code copy of the Software. “Use” means, for your personal purposes, storing, loading, installing, executing, or displaying the Software. You may not modify the Software or disable any licensing or control features of the Software.  Athletes’ Performance reserves all rights not expressly granted to you in this EULA. </p>

                <p><b>Ownership.</b> The Software is owned and copyrighted by Athletes’ Performance. Your license confers no title to, or ownership in, the Software and is not a sale of any rights in the Software.  You may not copy the Software.  Athletes’ Performance shall own all right, title and interest in and to any derivatives, enhancements or modifications to the Software.</p>

                <p><b>No Disassembly or Decryption.</b> You may not modify the Software and shall not cause or permit decompilation, disassembly, or reverse engineering of the Software or otherwise attempt to derive the source code of the Software.  You may not decrypt the Software unless decryption is a necessary part of the operation of the Software. </p>

                <p><b>Termination.</b> Athletes’ Performance may terminate your license upon notice for convenience or for failure to comply with any of these license terms. Your license will automatically terminate upon any transfer of the Software.  Upon termination, you must immediately return the Software, in any form. </p>

                <p><b>Privacy Policy.</b>  The Software collects information about you when you use it.  Please review our Privacy Policy which also governs your use of the Software, including information collection and information uses. </p>

                <p><b>Export Requirements & U.S. Government Restricted Rights.</b> You agree to comply fully with all relevant export laws and regulations, including but not limited to the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (collectively, “Export Controls”).  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you expressly agree that you shall not export, directly or indirectly, re-export, divert, or transfer the Software, or any direct product thereof to any destination, company or person restricted or prohibited by Export Controls.  </p>

                <p><b>Warranty Disclaimers & Liability Limitation.</b>  THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND ATHLETES’ PERFORMANCE MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR USE OR PURPOSE. ATHLETES’ PERFORMANCE IS NOT LIABLE FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR LOST PROFITS, EVEN IF IT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY AND DISCLAIMERS OF DAMAGES APPLY REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF AN ACTION AND WILL APPLY EVEN IF A REMEDY FAILS IN ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</p>

                <p><b>Dispute Resolution.</b>  Excluding equitable relief, you agree that any dispute arising out of or related to this EULA shall be submitted to a mutually agreed upon JAMS mediator for non-binding confidential mediation in Phoenix, Arizona.  If the dispute cannot be resolved through mediation, it shall be submitted to final, binding and confidential arbitration before JAMS in Phoenix, Arizona before one (1) arbitrator.  If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator within fourteen (14) days, then the parties shall request and accept an arbitrator selected by JAMS.  The parties agree that the procedures outlined in this section are the exclusive methods of dispute resolution.  </p>

                <p><b>Governing Law.</b>  This EULA shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Arizona.  You hereby agree and consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any state or federal court located in Phoenix, Arizona and you hereby waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non-conveniens.</p>

                <p><b>Class Action Waiver.</b>  ANY PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE OR LITIGATE ANY DISPUTE IN ANY FORUM WILL BE CONDUCTED SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. NEITHER YOU NOR ATHLETES’ PERFORMANCE WILL SEEK TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD AS A CLASS ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR IN ANY OTHER PROCEEDING IN WHICH EITHER PARTY ACTS OR PROPOSES TO ACT IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. NO ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING WILL BE COMBINED WITH ANOTHER WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES TO ALL AFFECTED ARBITRATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS. IF THE CLASS ACTION WAIVER IN THIS SECTION IS FOUND TO BE ILLEGAL OR UNENFORCEABLE AS TO ALL OR SOME PARTS OF A DISPUTE, THEN THE DISPUTE RESOLUTION SECTION WILL NOT APPLY TO THOSE PARTS. INSTEAD, THOSE PARTS WILL BE SEVERED AND PROCEED IN A COURT OF LAW AS PROVIDED HEREIN, WITH THE REMAINING PARTS PROCEEDING IN ARBITRATION. IF ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS SECTION IS FOUND TO BE ILLEGAL OR UNENFORCEABLE, THAT PROVISION WILL BE SEVERED WITH THE REMAINDER OF THIS SECTION REMAINING IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT.  </p>

                <p><b>Entire Agreement.</b>  This EULA sets forth and contains the entire agreement with regard to the matters set forth herein between. There are no promises, terms, conditions, or obligations other than those contained herein. This EULA supersedes all previous communications, representations, or agreements, either verbal or written, between and among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.</p>

                <p><b>Conflicts.</b>  Reference is made to that certain Lifecycle Initiative Services Agreement (the “Lifecycle Agreement”), dated August 22, 2013, by and between the Former Player Benefits Plan, established as of 20th day of August, 2013 by the Former Player Benefits Trust in accordance with Section 5 of Article 12 of the NFL/NFLPA Collective Bargaining Agreement, and Athletes’ Performance Elite, LLC.
