            and other applications, software and technology to help you enhance your fitness, health and wellness (the
            "Platform"). By interacting with the EXOS Entities (such as, for example, through the Platform), YOU CONSENT to our

            readiness questionnaires, evaluations or assessments, actual workout and usage data, or your feedback) or otherwise
            received from you (e.g., letters, over the phone, by interacting with our mobile applications or other online

            each of those sites to obtain an understanding of how your information is used or shared by those
            third-parties. </p>
