For these hosting services, We executed the &quot;Data Processing Addendum&quot; of AWS, which is in line with the Standard Contractual Clauses (Commission Decision 2010/87/EU), for all relevant data collections, processing and use pursuant to this Privacy Policy. On 6 March 2015, the Commission Nationale Pour La Protection Des Données (“CNPD”) issued a letter, confirming that the Data Processing Addendum of AWS was in line with the Standard Contractual Clauses of Commission Decision 2010/87/EU and acknowledging that, by using the “Data Processing Addendum” together with its annexes, AWS will make sufficient contractual commitments to provide a legal framework to its international data flows, in accordance with Article 26 of Directive 95/46/EC.

<p>We may also use or disclose your information when compelled by a court or other government authority of competent jurisdiction in connection with a legal action, or other proceeding (including without limitation, in response to a court order or a subpoena or valid e-discovery request). For any such use or disclosure, however, We will take reasonable steps to verify the authenticity of such a request prior to disclosing your information and disclose the minimum amount necessary to comply with the request.

Upon receipt, verification and confirmation of your request, We will process your opt-out and you will receive an e-mail confirming that you have opted-out and that We have stopped using/collecting your Personal Information as well as deleted it, if the Personal Data is no longer required by law. In addition, the confirmation email will provide instructions and a service list on how to further avoid providing Us with Personal Information in connection with any Services that you may attempt to use or where applicable, still be permitted to use after you have opted-out.</p>
<p>● For example, if a fitness center requires you to swipe an access badge to gain access to the fitness facility and you elect to not share any Personal Information with Us, your access badge will no longer work and you will not be able to use any Services at the fitness center, nor any Services that retain or require your Personal Information in to provide you with a customized experience, or that require you to log-in to an account. You will also not be able to use our online applications such as Ops, Journey or personalized features of Cardio enabled exercise equipment.</p>
<p>● Even if you elect for Us to stop using/collecting your Personal Information, We may: (i) retain your first and last name and date when you accepted the Terms and registered to use the Services if this is required for the purposes for which We collected this data or otherwise required by law; (ii) continue to use data that is already part of an Aggregate Data set or that is not and no longer identifiable to you.</p>

If you submit Personal Information to Us online, We recommend that you terminate your browser session before leaving your computer.

<p>When We share your Personal Information with our partners, affiliated companies, and service providers, your Personal Information may be transferred to and/or made accessible from countries out of the European Economic Area (EEA).  In such circumstances, We will enter into model contractual clauses as adopted by the European Commission. These model contractual clauses were adopted the European Commission to transfer Personal Data to non-EEA countries that do not provide an adequate level of data protection according to the European Commission. These model contractual clauses offer adequate safeguards for such a transfer. Otherwise, We rely on alternative legal bases such as the Privacy Shield. This EU-US Privacy Shield is a framework for transfers of Personal Data for commercial purposes between the EEA and the United States to provide companies with a mechanism to comply with data protection requirements, Where applicable, We rely on binding corporate rules where our partners or service providers have adopted such internal policies approved by European data protection authorities. These binding corporate rules are a code for the transfer of data within our organizations and companies and provides for safeguards of your Personal Data.</p>
