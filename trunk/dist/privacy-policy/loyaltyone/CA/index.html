        <p>
            HSG limits its collection of Personal Information to that which is
            reasonably required to accurately complete the services for which we have
            been retained. We are committed to respecting the privacy of an
            individual’s Personal Information and will not collect Personal Information
            which is not reasonably required.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Consent</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            We require that consent to use Personal Information be obtained at the time
            of its collection. If HSG collects the Personal Information directly from
            an individual, HSG will obtain express consent for the collection, use,
            transfer and disclosure of your Personal Information as outlined in this
            Privacy Policy. If you do not consent, please do not provide or otherwise
            disclose your Personal Information. Subject to legal and contractual
            requirements and reasonable notice, you may refuse to consent to our
            collection, use, transfer and disclosure of your Personal Information or
            you may withdraw your consent by contacting our Privacy Officer as detailed
            below. We will explain the consequences of the withdrawal of your consent.
            Your decision to withhold or withdraw your consent to certain uses of
            Personal Information may restrict our ability to provide certain services
            to you.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, HSG may be contracted by employers to provide third party
            consulting analysis of employer sponsored employee services, online
            programs or digital equipment. In these cases, Personal Information may be
            collected by another party before it is provided to HSG. Where possible in
            these circumstances, HSG will take reasonable measures to require that
            consent for their use of the Personal Information has been obtained.
        </p>
        <p>
            If HSG uses Personal Information and Analytics Data it has collected, or
            has been provided, for any reasons other than those disclosed to an
            individual at the time consent was given, then HSG will seek to obtain
            consent for the new use of the information.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Disclosure and Retention of Personal Information</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            HSG retains Personal Information it collects only as long as it is
            necessary to completely fulfill our services. HSG maintains a records
            retention policy. The retention policy has been developed to meet HSG’s
            record retention requirements consistent with good business practices and
            known industry standards.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the event that HSG decides to purchase, sell, reorganize or transfer the
            assets of a business, including any Personal Information held by that
            business, HSG’s client information may be subject to review for such
            purpose by another party. Should HSG or such other party wish to use any
            Personal Information for purposes not described herein, then consent for
            such use of the information will first be obtained.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note: As is the case with all companies, HSG may be lawfully bound to
            disclose Personal Information for purposes other than those described at
            the time consent was obtained. These purposes have been described in
            applicable privacy legislation as those designed to protect personal and/or
            public interest.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Accuracy of and Access to Personal Information</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            HSG recognizes that Personal Information can change. We encourage our
            clients to keep their Personal Information current so that we may provide
            the best services possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            If we are working with a company to manage a company-sponsored service or
            program, employees will be required to inform their employer of any changes
            to their Personal Information.
        </p>
        <p>
            Where we have a direct client relationship, Personal Information can be
            changed upon inquiry by email, phone or fax and in certain circumstances,
            on a website provided and/or maintained by HSG. You have a right to access,
            correct or delete your Personal Information in HSG’s custody or control,
            subject to limited exceptions. A request to access Personal Information
            must be made in writing to the Privacy Officer and sufficient detail to
            identify the Personal Information and the correction or deletion of the
            information being sought should be provided.
        </p>
        <p>
            In some circumstances, we may not be able to provide access to your
            Personal Information, for example if it contains the Personal Information
            of other persons, if it constitutes confidential commercial information, or
            if it is protected by solicitor-client privilege. If we deny your request
            for access to, or refuse a request to correct, your Personal Information,
            we will advise you of the reasons for this refusal.
        </p>
        <p>
            If your Personal Information is demonstrated to be inaccurate or
            incomplete, within a reasonable time of being notified, HSG will update
            records to reflect changes in Personal Information.
        </p>
        <p>
            The HSG Privacy Officer regularly reviews our practices and procedures to
            ensure compliance with this Privacy Policy and will note your correction or
            deletion request in the file, regardless of whether a change was made.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Safeguarding Personal Information</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            HSG is committed to ensuring the security of customer Personal Information
            in order to protect it from unauthorized access, collection, use and/or
            disclosure. HSG has inventoried the various ways in which we store
            information, and has put reasonable physical, organizational, and
            technological security measures in place for Personal Information, whether
            in paper, mechanical, electronic or other form, to ensure the security of
            this information within our premises, at any offsite storage locations and
            in our system databases.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Privacy Policy terms have been explained to each authorized employee or
            agent. Each authorized employee or agent must acknowledge their
            understanding of this Privacy Policy and our privacy procedures. Moreover,
            HSG provides ongoing training to staff on privacy legislation and continues
            to update all staff on privacy related issues and legislation.
        </p>
        <p>
            As part of the hiring process, each of our employees must sign a
            confidentiality agreement which outlines HSG’s expectation of its staff to
            act responsibly in the handling of client Personal Information. Through
            this agreement, employees are aware that a breach of confidentiality could
            result in termination of their employment.
        </p>
        <p>
            We regularly review and update our security policies and controls to ensure
            ongoing Personal Information security as technology changes.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Transfer of Information to Other Countries</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Personal Information may be accessed by or transferred to the United
            States, Europe or to our data processors elsewhere in the world for the
            purposes described in this Privacy Policy or for storage purposes. When we
            access or transfer Personal Information, we do so in compliance with
            applicable law. Additionally, we protect the privacy and security of
            Personal Information regardless of where it is processed or stored.
        </p>
        <p>
            Only authorized HSG employees and our agents may access and use the
            Personal Information for the identified purposes.<strong></strong>

        <p>
            Health Systems Group is not responsible for the content or the privacy
            policies of websites to which it may link and our privacy policy does not

            <strong>HSG’s Commitment to Children’s Privacy</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Protecting children’s privacy is important to us. It is our policy to
            respect children’s online privacy and all applicable laws. Health Systems
            Group recommends that children ask a parent for permission before sending
            Personal Information to HSG or to anyone else online.

        <p>
            <strong>Use of IP Addresses</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer
            whenever you are surfing the internet. Web servers automatically identify
            your computer by its IP address. We may collect IP addresses for the
            purposes of system administration, aggregate data collection, and to audit
            the use of our website. When clients request pages from our website, our
            servers log the requesting clients’ IP addresses. We normally will not link
            IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that clients’
            sessions will be logged, but client identity remains anonymous to us. We
            can and will use IP addresses to identify a client when we feel it is
            necessary to enforce compliance with our rules or terms of service or to
            protect our service, website, or any person, or where it is otherwise
            authorized or required by law.
