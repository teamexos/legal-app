<p>I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT MY ATTENDANCE OR USE OF THE FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT OR PARTICIPATION IN ANY CPC ACTIVITIES OR PROGRAMS OR RECEIVING ANY SERVICES (AS DEFINED ABOVE) (COLLECTIVELY, &quot;CPC SERVICES&quot;), INCLUDING THE USE OF PERSONAL TRAINERS, POSSESS RISKS, KNOWN AND/OR UNKNOWN AND COULD CAUSE INJURY TO ME. AS A PRE-CONDITION TO ALLOWING ME TO RECEIVE, PARTICIPATE IN, ATTEND OR USE ANY CPC SERVICES, I ACCEPT THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ATTENDANCE AND USE OF ANY SUCH CPC SERVICES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE FOLLOWING RISKS: WORSENING OF ANY MEDICAL CONDITION OR INJURY I MIGHT HAVE, PERSONAL INJURY, THEFT, OR CONTAGION. I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AS A PRE-CONDITION TO UTILIZING ANY CPC SERVICES I WILL INQUIRE ABOUT ANY RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM AND THAT I WILL FOLLOW ALL INSTRUCTIONS RELATED TO THE CPC SERVICES. I REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT I CONSULT A PHYSICIAN ON A REGULAR BASIS REGARDING MY HEALTH, AND THAT I WILL NOT PURCHASE, RECEIVE, PARTICIPATE IN, ATTEND OR USE ANY CPC SERVICES IF I AM AWARE OF A CONDITION OR INJURY THAT MAY MAKE SUCH CPC SERVICES INADVISABLE OR THAT MAY INJURE ANOTHER PERSON OR CREATE A RISK THAT ANOTHER PERSON WOULD CATCH A SICKNESS OR DISEASE FROM ME. I UNDERSTAND THAT I AM ADVISED TO CONSULT MY PHYSICIAN REGARDING CPC SERVICES PRIOR TO PURCHASING, RECEIVING, PARTICIPATING IN, ATTENDING OR USING ANY CPC SERVICES. IF I HAVE FURTHER QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS REGARDING CPC SERVICES, I AGREE TO ASK CPC PERSONNEL WORKING ON-SITE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION PRIOR TO RECEIVING, PARTICIPATING IN, ATTENDING OR USING ANY CPC SERVICES. I UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS MY RESPONSIBILITY TO NOT EXERCISE, OR TO CEASE EXERCISING, IF I AM UNFIT, SICK OR DO NOT FEEL WELL FOR ANY REASON. I UNDERSTAND THAT TRAINERS OR EQUIPMENT/COMPUTERS MAY ENCOURAGE ME TO EXERT MYSELF TO IMPROVE MY PERFORMANCE AND TRAINING, AND THAT IT IS MY RESPONSIBILITY TO COMMUNICATE TO THE TRAINER OR TO CEASE EXERCISING AND IGNORE SUCH ENCOURAGEMENT IF I DO NOT FEEL WELL OR FEEL I COULD BECOME INJURED. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE CPC SERVICES MAY INCLUDE EXERCISES THAT INCORPORATE WHOLE BODY VIBRATION. I UNDERSTAND THAT EXERCISE INCORPORATING WHOLE BODY VIBRATION IS NOT RIGHT FOR ALL PEOPLE, AND THAT WOMEN WHO ARE PREGNANT OR MAY BECOME PREGNANT SHOULD NOT INCORPORATE WHOLE BODY VIBRATION INTO THEIR EXERCISE PROGRAM. I UNDERSTAND THAT CPC CAN PROVIDE AN EXERCISE PROGRAM THAT DOES NOT INCORPORATE WHOLE BODY VIBRATION AND THAT IT IS MY RESPONSIBILITY TO INFORM CPC STAFF IF I DO NOT WISH TO INCORPORATE WHOLE BODY VIBRATION INTO MY EXERCISE PROGRAM. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE DECISION TO INCORPORATE WHOLE BODY VIBRATION INTO MY EXERCISE PROGRAM IS ENTIRELY MY OWN, AND THAT IF I INCORPORATE WHOLE BODY VIBRATION INTO MY EXERCISE PROGRAM IT IS MY RESPONSIBILITY TO STOP EXERCISE IMMEDIATELY, AND TO CONSULT WITH MY PHYSICIAN IMMEDIATELY, IF I FEEL DIZZY, FAINT, SHORT OF BREATH OR EXPERIENCE ANY PAIN DURING EXERCISE UTILIZING VIBRATION. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE CPC SERVICES ARE NOT AN EXACT SCIENCE AND THAT NO GUARANTEES OR ASSURANCES HAVE BEEN MADE TO ME CONCERNING THE OUTCOME AND/OR RESULT FROM THE CPC SERVICES. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, I (ON MY OWN BEHALF AND THE BEHALF OF MY HEIRS, EXECUTORS, ADMINISTRATORS AND ASSIGNS) HEREBY RELEASE CPC, ITS OFFICERS, MEMBERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS (AND ANY CPC AFFILIATES THAT OWN OR OPERATE ANY FACILITY I USE PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT) FROM ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF THE ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF CPC, ITS OFFICERS, MEMBERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS (AND ANY CPC AFFILIATES THAT OWN OR OPERATE ANY FACILITY I USE PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT), THE CPC SERVICES, INCLUDING CLAIMS FOR NEGLIGENCE OR CLAIMS ARISING FROM THE USE OF TRAINERS (YET NOT INCLUDING CLAIMS FOR INTENTIONAL TORTIOUS ACTS OR CLAIMS THAT I MAY NOT RELEASE BY LAW). I REPRESENT THAT I WILL NOT RECEIVE, PARTICIPATE IN, ATTEND OR USE ANY CPC SERVICES IF I POSSESS A CONDITION OR INJURY THAT MAKES SUCH RECEIPT, PARTICIPATION IN, ATTENDANCE OR USE INADVISABLE. FURTHERMORE, I AGREE NOT TO RECEIVE, PARTICIPATE IN, ATTEND OR USE ANY CPC SERVICES THAT ARE BEYOND MY PHYSICAL CAPACITY. I WILL INFORM CPC AND ANY TRAINER WORKING WITH ME OF ANY CONDITIONS I HAVE OR MAY HAVE THAT COULD BE AGGRAVATED OR COULD CAUSE INJURY OR DISEASE TO ME OR ANOTHER. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY TERM TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT, NO TERM OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL CONSTITUTE A WAIVER OF YOUR RIGHTS UNDER TITLE 2.5 OF THE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTIONS 1812.80 THROUGH 1812.98. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, YOU EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY AND ALL RIGHTS AND BENEFITS CONFERRED UPON YOU BY THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 1542 OF THE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE OR BY THE STATUTES OR COMMON LAW OF ANY JURISDICTION WHICH HAVE THE SAME EFFECT AS THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 1542 WHICH READS: A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR. YOU ASSUME ALL RISKS ATTENDANT TO RELEASE OF CLAIMS PREVIOUSLY OR HEREAFTER ARISING WHICH ARE UNKNOWN, UNFORESEEN OR LATENT THROUGH THE EFFECTIVE DATE. YOU UNDERSTAND AND ACKNOWLEDGE THE SIGNIFICANCE AND CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH A SPECIFIC WAIVER OF THE PROTECTIONS OF SECTION 1542. FURTHER, I HEREBY AGREE TO INDEMNIFY, DEFEND AND HOLD HARMLESS CPC AND ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, MEMBERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, DAMAGES AND LIABILITIES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE RECEIPT, PARTICIPATION IN, ATTENDANCE OR USE OF THE CPC SERVICES, MY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT, MY VIOLATION OF THE CPC POLICIES OR MY NEGLIGENT OR INTENTIONALLY TORTIOUS ACTS OR OMISSIONS. Dispute Resolution.The parties will attempt in good faith to resolve any issue, dispute, or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement. If any controversy or claim arising out of, or in any way related to, this Agreement is not resolved, at the request of either party, then the parties agree that (excluding equitable relief and any claims for nonpayment made by CPC) any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be submitted to a mutually agreed upon mediator for non-binding, confidential mediation in Phoenix, Arizona. If the dispute cannot be resolved through mediation, it shall be submitted to final, binding and confidential arbitration before JAMS in Phoenix, Arizona. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of Arizona and the parties hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the courts sitting in Phoenix, Arizona. The parties agree they shall not disclose the existence, content or results of the arbitration without the written consent of both parties, other than to their attorneys or as required by law. The arbitration award will be valid and binding upon the parties, and judgment thereon may be entered and enforced as a final judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
