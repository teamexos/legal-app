## Waiver, Release & Representations of Good Health

AS A PRE-CONDITION TO ALLOWING ME TO USE ANY FACILITIES OR EQUIPMENT OR PARTICIPATE IN ANY EXERCISES, PROGRAMS OR SERVICES AVAILABLE (REGARDLESS OF WHERE SUCH FACILITIES, EQUIPMENT, EXERCISES, PROGRAMS OR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED BY EXOS), I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I ACCEPT THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ATTENDANCE AT AND USE OF ANY AND ALL SUCH FACILITIES, EQUIPMENT, EXERCISES, PROGRAMS AND SERVICES.

THE RISK OF INJURY FROM PARTICIPATION IN PHYSICAL FITNESS, SPORTS TRAINING, ATHLETIC EVENTS AND OTHER STRENUOUS PHYSICAL ACTIVITY (COLLECTIVELY, “TRAINING”), IS SIGNIFICANT, INCLUDING THE RISK OF SERIOUS INJURY AND/OR DEATH. I KNOWINGLY AND FREELY ASSUME ALL SUCH RISKS OF PARTICIPATION IN TRAINING, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO RISKS ARISING FROM OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE CONDITION OF THE FACILITIES, EQUIPMENT, FIELDS, VENUES AND SURROUNDING PREMISES, THE ACTIONS OF PERSONS OTHER THAN MYSELF, MY OWN ACTIONS, AND TRAVEL TO AND FROM TRAINING (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, TRAVEL SERVICES PROVIDED BY EXOS OR IN ANY VEHICLE OWNED, OPERATED, OR ASSOCIATED WITH EXOS).

I UNDERSTAND THAT EXOS MAKES NO WARRANTIES (WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED) AND SHALL IN NO EVENT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR THE DEFECTIVE OR DANGEROUS CONDITION OF THE FACILITIES, EQUIPMENT, FIELDS, VENUES AND SURROUNDING PREMISES, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT SUCH CONDITION(S) RESULT(S) SOLELY FROM THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR INTENTIONAL ACTS OF EXOS.

I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT PRIOR TO UTILIZING ANY FACILITIES, EQUIPMENT, EXERCISES, PROGRAMS OR SERVICES, I HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO AND WILL INQUIRE ABOUT ANY RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM AND THAT I WILL FOLLOW ALL INSTRUCTIONS RELATED TO THE FACILITIES, EQUIPMENT, EXERCISE, PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. I FURTHER WARRANT AND CERTIFY THAT EITHER (1) I HAVE NO HEALTH CONDITIONS OR DEFECTS THAT WOULD PREVENT ME FROM PARTICIPATING SAFELY IN THE TRAINING, THAT I HAVE TAKEN EVERY REASONABLE ACT NECESSARY TO MAKE THIS STATEMENT IN RELATION TO MY PARTICIPATION, AND THAT I AM OTHERWISE FIT AND HEALTHY ENOUGH TO SAFELY PARTICIPATE, OR (2) I WILL CONSULT A PHYSICIAN TO OBTAIN GUIDELINES THAT I WILL FOLLOW PRIOR TO ENGAGING IN ANY TRAINING.
