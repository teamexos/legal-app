+	For users of the cloud based services Ops, Journey, and Cardio/EDS, we may store your Personal Information on servers hosted by Amazon Web Services, LLC or their affiliates, at their data center located in the United States of America. For these hosting services, CP International and AP and API executed the “Data Processing Addendum” of AWS, which is in line with the Standard Contractual Clauses (Commission Decision 2010/87/EU), for all relevant data collections, processing and use pursuant to this Privacy Policy.
On 6 March 2015, the Commission Nationale Pour La Protection Des Données (“CNPD”) issued a letter, confirming that the Data Processing Addendum of AWS was in line with the Standard Contractual Clauses of Commission Decision 2010/87/EU and acknowledging that, by using the “Data Processing Addendum” together with its annexes, AWS will make sufficient contractual commitments to provide a legal framework to its international data flows, in accordance with Article 26 of Directive 95/46/EC.  AP, CP International and API also may disclose your Personal Information (to the extent permitted by applicable law) limited to the amount necessary:
+	in situations where you have requested Services from us that require sharing or disclosing your information and where you have authorized such sharing or disclosure for such services (note: you may not be able to fully utilize or participate in certain services or products if you refuse to agree to the required sharing or disclosure of your information that is necessary to perform or provide those services);
+	to any other entity that acquires all or a portion of our organization by a merger or acquisition of AP, reorganization, operation of law, or a sale of some or all of AP or AP assets, if the disclosure is compliant with applicable data protection law.

### Disclosure of Personal Data to Legal or Governmental Authorities.
CP International and API may also use or disclose your information when compelled by a court or other government authority of competent jurisdiction in connection with a legal action, or other proceeding (including without limitation, in response to a court order or a subpoena or valid e-discovery request). For any such use or disclosure, however, we will take reasonable steps to verify the authenticity of such a request prior to disclosing your information and disclose the minimum amount necessary to comply with the request.  Should we receive such a request that requires disclosure of your Personal Information and we are permitted to notify you of the request, we will make the attempt to do so based on the current contact information within the system.

### Retention of Personal Information/Change How Your Personal Information is Used.
We retain your Personal Information for only as long as is necessary for the respective purposes for which we collected it from you to respond to your request and/or provide the Services you participate in, or as otherwise required by law. Even though we may retain the Personal information we collect from you, at any time you have the right to change how we use/collect your Personal Information. See How to Opt Out.

### How to Opt Out.
You may revoke any consent given to us with regard to the collection, processing and use of your personal information at any time for the future and also generally request that CP International and AP stop using and collecting your Personal Information.

To make such an Opt-Out request, go to https://optout.teamexos.com, and complete the form which will ask you for the information that CP International and AP and API need for you to opt-out (e.g., name and e-mail address).  Upon receipt, verification and confirmation of your request, CP International as well as AP and API will process your opt-out and you will receive an e-mail confirming that you have opted-out and that CP International and AP and API have stopped using/collecting your Personal Information as well as deleted it, if the data is no longer required by law.  In addition, the confirmation email will provide instructions and a service list on how to further avoid providing CP International and AP and API with Personal Information in connection with any Services that you may attempt to use or where applicable, still be permitted to use after you have opted-out.

+	For example, if a fitness center requires you to swipe an access badge to gain access to the fitness facility and you elect to not share any Personal Information with AP or CP International, your access badge will no longer work and you will not be able to use any services at the fitness center, nor any Services that retain or require your Personal Information in to provide you with a customized experience, or that require you to log-in to an account.  You will also not be able to use our online applications such as Ops, Journey or personalized features of Cardio enabled exercise equipment.

+	Even if you elect for CP International and AP and API to stop using/collecting your Personal Information, we may: (i) retain your first and last name and date when you accepted the Terms and registered to use the Services if this is required for the purposes for which we collected this data or otherwise required by law; (ii) continue to use data that is already part of an Aggregate Data set or that is not and no longer identifiable to you.

Upon the termination of CP International’s or API’s or AP’s agreement with the Sponsor of the Services (if applicable), CP International and API and AP will stop using/collecting your Personal Information, but may: (i) retain your first and last name if this is required for the purposes for which we collected this data or otherwise required by law; and (ii) continue to use data that is already  part of an Aggregate Data set or was collected as Non-Personal Information, or has been anonymized so that it cannot be identified back to you..

__Opt-Out From Mailings Only:__ From time to time, you may receive periodic e-mail messages. If at any time you wish to stop receiving emails from AP or CP International please unsubscribe from the mailing list or where applicable, notify your onsite fitness coach.
