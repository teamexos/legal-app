**This Google Privacy Statement for the United States shall describe Core Performance Centers, LLC ("EXOS") privacy practices in lieu of the EXOS Privacy Policy, for authorized Google Participants of the Wellness Programs/Facilities that are managed or provided by EXOS within the United States.**

*Google Privacy Statement (United States):  9/29/14*

This privacy statement (the "Privacy Statement") describes the privacy practices for Core Performance Centers, LLC ("EXOS") in connection with the information EXOS collects from individuals through any Google corporate wellness facility/program, whether online, on paper or in person (each, a “Program”).  EXOS respects the privacy of those persons who access and/or use any Program ("you," "your," "user," or collectively "users") and is committed to protecting the privacy of the personally identifiable information we collect from you.  EXOS does not knowingly collect or solicit Information from children under the age of thirteen (13) and you must be 18 years of age or older to use a Program. The purpose of this Privacy Statement is to inform you about what information we collect from you, how we use that information, and whether we disclose that information to anyone. By your acknowledgment of this Privacy Statement, you expressly consent to the use and disclosure of information as described in this Privacy Statement.

**What Information We Collect and How We Collect Information.** We collect information in several ways by your use of a Program, as well as from forms you submit to us, or personal correspondence, such as emails or letters that you send to us. We may ask you to voluntarily provide us with personal information through a Program.

We collect two types of information: personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information. Personally identifiable information is information that identifies you or can be used to identify or contact you ("Personally Identifiable Information").  You will always own your Personally Identifiable Information.  We also may collect information that by itself typically cannot be used to identify or contact you, such as demographic information (for example, your age or gender) and other anonymous aggregate statistical data involving the use of a Program ("Non-Personally Identifiable Information").

At registration, we collect the following information: your name, email addresses, password, postal addresses, telephone number, date of birth, gender, age, geographic location, badge ID number, and emergency contact person and their telephone number. Through our physical activity readiness questionnaire, evaluations and assessments, we collect the following information and types of information: height, weight, injury history, physical assessment scores (including VO2 score, and Functional Movement Screen score), nutrition assessment results, motivation assessment results, any heart rate restrictions to which you may be subject and relevant heart rate cap, Body Mass Index, body composition, training history, physical activity readiness information, training goals, initial fitness level, and other information either desirable or necessary to provide quality services to you. On an ongoing basis, we collect: when you visit the fitness center, your self-reported answers to questions such as your purpose for visiting the fitness center and how you feel on the day of your visit, workout data (including date, duration, activity, heart rate and power generated), and other information either desirable or necessary to provide quality services to you.

We may also collect information about your interaction with a Program, such as your use of a Program and communication preferences.

Additionally, we collect aggregated, Non-Personally Identifiable Information regarding the number of registered members at each corporate wellness facility, usage data based on hours of operation, types of services and equipment, customer survey scores, and fitness outcome data.

**Cookie policy:** When you browse a Program that involves a website or other on-line system operated by EXOS, a temporary cookie is placed on your computer that helps EXOS collect information to help us better understand our visitors' interests and to better serve you. What are Cookies? "Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your web browser's software on your computer's hard drive or temporarily in your computer's memory. The use of cookies is an industry standard and it enhances the user experience and your access to information on a website or other on-line system operated by EXOS. Cookies are used on most major web sites. Cookies enable EXOS to recognize you and personalize your viewing experience on a website or other on-line system operated by EXOS. EXOS use cookies for a variety of purposes including, but not limited to, to recognize user access (or logon) privileges to a website or other on-line system operated by EXOS Entities (such as to store user names and other information supplied at registration), track usage and traffic patterns, provide information and advertisements for goods or services that EXOS thinks may interest you based on your interest in and use of a website or other on-line system operated by EXOS, and track the number of users who visit and use a website or other on-line system operated by EXOS. Although most web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, you may be able to decline the placement of a cookie on your hard drive by using the appropriate feature(s) of your web browser software (if available) to delete the cookie. Please note, however, that certain areas or features of the website or other on-line system operated by EXOS will not function properly if your web browser does not accept cookies.

In addition to using Cookies, a website or other on-line system operated by EXOS may employ "pixel tracking", a common process which may be used in connection with advertisements and or internal tracking. Pixel tracking involves the use of pixel tags that are not visible to the user and consist of a few lines of computer code. Pixel tracking measures the effectiveness of advertisements and compiles aggregate and specific usage statistics. A "pixel tag" is an invisible tag placed on certain pages of websites that is used to track an individual user's activity. EXOS may access these pixel tags to identify activity and interests that may allow us to better match our goods, services, and other offers with your interests and needs. For example, if you visit a website or other on-line system operated by EXOS from an advertisement on another website, the pixel tag will allow the advertiser to track that its advertisement brought you to a website or other on-line system operated by EXOS. If you visit a website or other on-line system operated by EXOS, and we link you to another website, we may also be able to determine that you were sent to and/or transacted with a third party website. This data is collected for use in our marketing and research.

**Why We Collect, and How We Use, Information.** EXOS collects information from you for the following reasons and, therefore, uses the information in the following ways:

●       to develop a customized training program tailored to each user's goals and needs

Upon receipt of your opt-out, EXOS will process your opt-out and you will receive an e-mail confirming that you have opted-out and that that EXOS has stopped using/collecting your Personally Identifiable Information.  In addition, the confirmation email will provide instructions and a service list on how to avoid providing EXOS with non-personally identifiable information in connection with any services that you may attempt to use after you have opted-out.  Please be aware that if you elect for EXOS to stop using/collecting your Personally Identifiable Information and to not collect any Non-Personally Identifiable Information in the future, your access to the services may be significantly limited or eliminated and such restrictions on or inability to access the services is not be a breach of this Privacy Statement or any agreement you have with EXOS.

Upon the termination of EXOS’ agreement with Google to provide the services, EXOS will stop using/collecting your Personally Identifiable Information or collecting any Non-Personally Identifiable Information and will only be able to use any Non-Personally Identifiable Information as provided in this Privacy Policy.
