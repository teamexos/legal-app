Your Personal Information is stored on servers (or in the case of Personal Information received from you in person, in writing or over the phone, in physical storage areas) protected by procedures and technology designed to block reasonably foreseeable intrusions by unauthorized third parties.  The AP Entity that has Your Personal Information will use commercially reasonable protections to safeguard Your Personal Information.

                <h2>E. Public Forums, Indemnification, Release & Content License From You</h2>

                <p>Any information that You disclose in public areas of a physical operation, website or other on-line system operated by any of the AP Entities (or, of course, the Internet in general) may become public information. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information in such areas. Any and all information posted, contributed or otherwise disclosed in/at/to a physical operation, website or other on-line system operated by any of the AP Entities may be used by the AP Entities in any manner, and the act of contributing information or other content constitutes a perpetual, royalty free, worldwide license for the AP Entities to use, reproduce, distribute, perform, display and make derivative works from such information and content. By submitting content or information to a physical operation, website or other on-line system operated by any of the AP Entities, You represent and warrant that such information and content does not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate the rights of any person or entity , and You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the AP Entities and their respective officers, directors, members, employees and contractors from any damages or liability that directly or indirectly arises out of or is related to Your contribution of content or information.

                <h2>F. Cookies; Pixel Tracking</h2>

                <p>i. When You browse a website or other on-line system operated by any of the AP Entities, a temporary cookie is placed on Your computer that helps the AP Entities collect information to help us better understand our visitors' interests and to better serve You. What are Cookies? "Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by Your web browser's software on Your computer's hard drive or temporarily in Your computer's memory. The use of cookies is an industry standard and it enhances the user experience and Your access to information on a website or other on-line system operated by any of the AP Entities. Cookies are used on most major web sites. Cookies enable the AP Entities to recognize You and personalize Your viewing experience on a website or other on-line system operated by any of the AP Entities.  The AP Entities use cookies for a variety of purposes including, but not limited to, to recognize user access (or logon) privileges to a website or other on-line system operated by any of the AP Entities (such as to store user names and other information supplied at registration), track usage and traffic patterns, provide information and advertisements for goods or services that any of the AP Entities think may interest You based on Your interest in and use of a website or other on-line system operated by any of the AP Entities, and track the number of users who visit and use a website or other on-line system operated by any of the AP Entities. Although most web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, You may be able to decline the placement of a cookie on Your hard drive by using the appropriate feature(s) of Your web browser software (if available) to delete the cookie. Please note, however, that certain areas or features of the website or other on-line system operated by any of the AP Entities will not function properly if Your web browser does not accept cookies.</p>

                <p>ii. In addition to using Cookies, a website or other on-line system operated by any of the AP Entities may employ "pixel tracking", a common process which may be used in connection with advertisements and or internal tracking. Pixel tracking involves the use of pixel tags that are not visible to the user and consist of a few lines of computer code. Pixel tracking measures the effectiveness of advertisements and compiles aggregate and specific usage statistics. A "pixel tag" is an invisible tag placed on certain pages of websites that is used to track an individual user's activity. We may access these pixel tags to identify activity and interests that may allow us to better match our goods, services, and other offers with Your interests and needs. For example, if You visit a website or other on-line system operated by any of the AP Entities from an advertisement on another website, the pixel tag will allow the advertiser to track that its advertisement brought You to a website or other on-line system operated by any of the AP Entities. If You visit a website or other on-line system operated by any of the AP Entities, and we link You to another website, we may also be able to determine that You were sent to and/or transacted with a third party website. This data is collected for use in our marketing and research.</p>

                <h2>G. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>

                <p>Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time without notice. Changes to this Privacy Policy will be posted at/to the physical operation, website or other on-line system operated by the AP Entities.</p>
